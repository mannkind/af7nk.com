Using a [C.H.I.P](https://getchip.com/pages/chip) and a hacked-apart SDR dongle, 
I setup an iGate near my parent's house. It's one of the only iGates for miles 
and miles.

It managed to [receive a few packets](http://aprs.fi/info/a/AF7NK-10).  
I need to look into replacing the stock SDR antenna, but I'm guessing that
I need a better location as well. 

Hmmm.
