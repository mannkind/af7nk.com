This weekend on my hike to [Snow Lake](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/snow-lake-1),
I tried out the automatic beaconing feature of my Kenwood TH-D72A.

I thought I had everything setup and working, but [obviously, I didn't.](http://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=12&ts=1474040400&te=1474070400&call=a%2FAF7NK)

During the hike I discovered that I could manually tune to the APRS frequency, and
the radio would broadcast the packet properly. That lead me to believe that 
the radio wouldn't broadcast APRS when tuned via a memory channel. 

It turns out that it's an [issue with Chirp](http://chirp.danplanet.com/issues/2455).
I hope it gets fixed soon!
