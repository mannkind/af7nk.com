My name is Dustin Brewer and I got my Amateur Extra license on 2014-12-30.

I became interested in amateur radio after a bit of time playing with 
Arduinos/RF24L01+ radios, and tinkering a bit with software-defined 
radio (specifically ADS-B). 

After studying for a couple weeks, I found an exam happening close to me. 
I took all three tests in one sitting because I did not want to have to pay 
the test-taking fee multiple times. I know people seem to hate _instant extras_,
but that's not my problem. :)
