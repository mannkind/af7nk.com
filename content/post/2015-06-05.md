While hiking the High Divide Trail, I sent an APRS packet from 
[Heart Lake](http://aprs.fi/#!mt=roadmap&z=11&ts=1433462400&te=1433548800&call=a%2FAF7NK) 
in the Olympic National Park with my crapply Boafeng UV-5R and a rollup J-Pole 
antenna. 

When I returned to civilization, I noticed that the tranmission was picked up in 
Canada! Maybe that's childsplay to some people, but it seemed pretty cool to me.
